### About

The Incurable Caravan’s Online Car Show is an online exhibit, which will persist indefinitely. All works accepted should expect to be a single element on a larger, scrolling page. The online aspect of the exhibition is deliberate, and the final website version will take advantage of this.

The Car Show seeks to intersect traditional, popular, experimental, and outsider styles with an enthusiasm towards all approaches to art-making. We welcome all interpretations of media and automotive transportation.

### Guidelines

Works submitted should include, allude to, or represent some elements of a car (doors, windows, wheels, engines, memories, etc.), but how you choose to present these elements is up to you. Not all internal spaces with windows are cars, and not all cars have doors. Your car can be literal or abstract, heartfelt or playful, technical or emotional, to any degree of detail.

Any media capable of existing online is encouraged, especially media that are normally challenging to program or format in other contexts. This includes:

* literary: poetry, short prose (< 500 words), haiku
* static visual: all traditional visual media: drawing, painting, photography, graphic/product design. For sculpture, photoscans or multiple photos are acceptable.
* moving visual: short film (< 3m), silent animations (gif/mp4)
* 3D: any 3D model or scene below 20k polygons
* audio: short pieces or songs (< 3m, loopable or not), interactive web audio, original sound design haikus (< 10s)
* multimedia: any combination of the above
* web: any self-contained webapps, games, data viz, net art, or CSS/SVG/Canvas animations, size restrictions TBD

Proposals for categories not included in this list and works-in-progress are allowed, as long as evidence of progress can be demonstrated on submission. Older works are also allowed, as long as they relate to a car in some form.

### Submissions

* **Due date: November 15th.**
* All works should be sent as non-expiring links.
