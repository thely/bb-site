### About

The Incurable Caravan’s Online Car Show is an indefinite online exhibit. All works accepted should expect to be a single element on a larger, scrolling page. The online aspect of the exhibition is deliberate.

The Car Show seeks to intersect traditional, popular, experimental, and outsider styles with an enthusiasm towards all approaches to art-making. We welcome all interpretations of media and automotive transportation.

### Guidelines

Works submitted should include, allude to, or represent some elements of a car (doors, windows, wheels, engines, memories, etc.), but how you choose to present these elements is up to you. Not all internal spaces with windows are cars, and not all cars have doors. Your car can be literal, abstract, heartfelt, playful, technical, emotional, or all of the above, to any degree of detail.

Any media capable of existing online is encouraged, especially media that are normally challenging to program or format in other contexts. This includes:

* literary: poetry, short prose (< 1000 words), haiku, interviews, interactive fiction
* static visual: all traditional visual media: drawing, painting, photography, graphic/product design. For sculpture, 3D photoscans or multiple photos are acceptable.
* moving visual: short film (< 3m), silent animations (gif/mp4), filmed choreography
* 3D: any 3D model or scene below 50k polygons
* audio: short pieces or songs (< 3m, loopable or not), interactive web audio, original sound design haikus (< 10s)
* multimedia: any combination of the above
* web: any self-contained webapps, games, data viz, generative art, net art, or CSS/SVG/Canvas animations, size restrictions TBD

Proposals for categories not included in this list and works-in-progress are allowed, as long as evidence of progress can be demonstrated on submission. Older works are also allowed, as long as they relate to a car in some form.

### Formatting

The works included in the Car Show will be assembled as a single, scrolling page. We will make a best effort to format everything in a way that respects individual artistic visions, while also taking into account the data limits of viewers around the globe. This means:

1. Media (images, audio, video) used in the Car Show may be compressed and resized smaller than the original sources sent in your submission. We will balance image/audio quality vs file size and maintain aspect ratios. Works that depend on extremely large file sizes might not work as well in this context. 
2. Poetry and prose (or other text-based media) will be included as text rather than images if possible. We are able to reflect your original formatting (including whitespace, font weights/sizes/families, colored text censoring) if desired, and will make a best effort to do so. Works that require a large number of different fonts or unique text effects may be displayed as SVG instead. *Caveat*: the Car Show will not be able to pay for web fonts that require licensing.
3. Non-standard media (3D objects, data viz, JS canvas art, etc) may be displayed with relevant Javascript libraries rather than as images. We'll work with selected artists to find good solutions for these works.

### Hosting

The Car Show will host the works submitted for as long as possible. We will make a best effort to keep a consistent domain name, but a backup/redirect will always exist on the hosting artist's webpage (Becky Brown). Artists selected will be sent both links when the Car Show is released.

Files hosted by the Car Show are only intended for the exhibition webpage. Artists selected must agree to refrain from using the Car Show's hosted media files of their works as personal hosting.

If displaying your work requires hosting outside our own (due to file sizes or using embedded services), we will not be able to pay for those services.

### Agreements

All work remains your own. We do not require submitted works to be exclusive to the Car Show. You affirm that you created the work you are submitting. If you're a performer and you'd like to submit a recording of yourself playing a piece written by someone else, ask them to submit the form on your behalf.
