title: the Incurable Caravan’s Online Car Show
---

### About

The Incurable Caravan’s Online Car Show is an online exhibit, which will persist indefinitely. All works accepted should expect to be a single element on a larger, scrolling page. The online aspect of the exhibition is deliberate, and the final website version will take advantage of this.

### Guidelines

Works submitted should have some elements of a car––doors, windows, wheels––but everything else is up to you. The work in its finished form does not necessarily need to resemble a car.

Any media capable of existing online is encouraged, especially media that are normally challenging to program or format in other contexts. This can include:

* literary: poetry, short prose (< 500 words), haiku
* static visual: all traditional visual media
* moving visual: short film (< 3m), silent animations (gif/mp4)
* 3D: any 3D model or scene below 20k polygons
* audio: short pieces or songs (< 3m, loopable or not), interactive web audio
* multimedia: any combination of the above
* web: any self-contained webapps, small games, or CSS/SVG/Canvas animations, size restrictions TBD

Proposals and works-in-progress are allowed, as long as evidence of progress can be demonstrated on submission. Older works are also allowed, as long as they relate to a car in some form.

### Submissions

Due by November 15th.
