This work was written in collaboration with [Zak Argabrite](https://www.zakargabrite.com/) as part of the [BROWSER 2021 Festival](https://browsersound.com/). It's a browser-based piece of interactive fiction following a single packet through its international trip from New Zealand to Virginia, talking about how the internet works and what its environmental impacts are along the way.

You've got two options for how to experience this piece. One, read it in its entirety, and take it all in. The second is to mash the space bar as fast as you can, and let the various speech and background sounds mash together.
