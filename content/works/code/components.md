[components](https://components.one) is articles about culture that usually involve some degree of large datasets. I've been its developer/designer since May 2019, when it was still on Wordpress. I've now migrated it over to Nuxt, which is based on Vue, which is based on Node. Using Nuxt on that site inspired me to migrate my own site to Nuxt as well - the `@nuxt/content` package makes the editing process really simple.
