I was asked to do a slightly nicer-looking version of the digital conference website for SEAMUS 2020, which was the first of many events to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. This is a pretty simple one, just threw it together using jekyll in Glitch, which I've come to like for doing initial site sketches.
