duration: "7'45\""
excerpt: "There's always another, every time. One more, and one more, and one more, and you’re still back at the beginning, after all that about how going was going and leaving was leaving. \"Let alone what can't,\" you’d say, if only the back and back and back again meant you’d really, truly spun to the other and elsewhere."
