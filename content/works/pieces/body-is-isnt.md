This work was a collaboration with choreographer Katie Schetlick and co-composer Heather Mease, done as part of a seminar on sound in space. Katie's concept for this was how churches and gyms were the initial venues for early experimental concerts, so we rolled with the sports/religion theme.

Many thanks to organist Alice Layman for lending her time for an extremely quick recording.
