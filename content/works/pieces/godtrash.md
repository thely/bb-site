### Context

This piece came from messing around in Jitter, specifically with programmatically exploding 3D models and recoloring them. The entire thing uses different exploded variations of the duck.dae model that ships with Max 8, which tend to form strange architectures when stretched out.

The patch itself is also nice as an Arthaus-y image generator. Here's what that looks like:

The title is a reference to Car Boys, a long YouTube series from Polygon about messing around in beamNG.drive, a "game"/simulator/playground with realistic destructible car physics. Whenever a collision would erupt a car mesh all over the screen, its polygons stretching infinitely in every direction, they called it "god trash."
