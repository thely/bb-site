### Context

This is a piece made in NodeJS, using ToneJS for audio. It's a telematic browser piece that doesn't involve any audio being sent along a server – just sequences of analyzed pitches, regenerated in each participant's browser. It means the experience is less "real," but sometimes being real isn't the point.
