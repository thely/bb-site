### Context

This piece has three movements, which are all historically true:

i. We think we could hear you in that one part of the third piece where it was just flute and cello
ii. Well-meaning concert-goer who says “that was beautiful” afterwards no matter how angry you
thought you sounded
iii. I hate to say it, but in this trio setting you’re actually playing too loud

It's a very noisy harp piece.
