### Context

This film was inspired by architectural visualization (archviz for short), which I encountered a lot in the process of learning to use [Blender](https://blender.org). Archviz is a field in its own right, but many of the renders I saw pictured perfect homes, completely uncluttered, as if no one lived there (of course, no one did, nor could they). I felt some weird desire to destroy these homes, or at least to position them in a more likely situation than inhuman cleanliness. Having a dream-like walk through one felt like the easiest way to destroy the intended use or appearance of the home, without actually ripping the model of the house to shreds.
