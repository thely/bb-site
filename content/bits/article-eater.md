In the late ’60s and early ’70s, a generation of photographers was growing up and deciding what lessons they might take from the history of photography. Instead of following this lead, they were exploring new material, pursuing images that were not constructed to be seen as photographic objects but rather as surrogate traces of reality. Lucy Lippold began to take up this growing trend in the early ’70s, and she has continued to do so. In her most recent exhibition, she presented a series of photographs that explore the relationship between objects and images, and, most particularly, between real and virtual space. The show included a selection of Lippold’s recent work—series such as “Décor” and “Virtual Paintings,” both 2003, and a selection of past work. The centerpiece of the exhibition, the series “Virtual Paintings,” 2004, was an installation that served as a central part of the exhibition. Visitors entered the large, darkened gallery and were placed in front of a large-scale painting that hung on the wall.

A projector placed on the floor projected the image of a wall onto the wall, and the resulting frieze was covered with a layer of black paint that covered the entire bottom half of the painting. The “virtual” in the exhibition title refers to the simultaneous presence and lack of actual two-dimensional representation. Here, the visitor’s gaze wandered down the painted surface, up the painted surface, and around the central hole. Lippold’s technique for this installation consisted of painting the entire surface of the large wall, then over it in a different color. Thus, the spectator was placed in the position of a second viewer as he or she walked around the central surface. The central hole was then filled with a different color from each time, allowing a constant interchange of color from one surface to the other. Thus, each visitor could bring his or her own color to the threshold of the central “hole” and investigate the different spatial associations that might arise from his or her color choices. The colors in these paintings and projections can be perceived as real colors—whether in a vacuum or in relation to the real thing. In their representation of reality, these works are deeply engaged with the world of physical objects and their representation and awareness. They are experiments in exploring the relationship between reality and perception.

This is the first solo exhibition in Switzerland of the young Zurich-born artist Nico Krebs, who is already known for his video installations and conceptual “wire paintings.” He is known for his interest in the possibility of connecting the seemingly disparate elements of a work—a telephone, a bicycle, and a motorbike as well as the event itself, which is here presented in a series of four new videos. The show features Krebs as the protagonist of a fictitious tale, as well as in a two-channel video installation that pits him against a wall of painted panels.

In the first video, he is suspended in the middle of a boat on an overloaded skiff, while in the second he sits on a chair, close to the roof of a building, on a sort of sled that is connected to a motorbike that is parked at the center of the gallery. The former scenario is accompanied by a sound track that evokes the continuous stream of news media. In the third and final video, Krebs is taken along a skiff that drags along a coastline, into which he is dragged along with the aid of a motorbike. The narrative thus concludes with that of the young boy in the skiff, who, having been dragged along a perilous seaboat, experiences a vision that transforms him into a pirate.

Curated by Giovanni Battista Levi has a long track record of developing environmentally oriented work. From the “Tranquility” series, 1978-79, to the current projects in the Antarctic and the Mississippi River delta, the works on view here comprise a mini-retrospective, covering the artist’s fifty-five-year career. The show’s title, “Pulso” (Stream), echoes the Latin word for river, and the works on view are characterized by a consistent and subtle modulation of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of surface and form. Battista Levi’s work is characterized by a precise and immaterial use of materials, a luminous, almost somatic light, and a consistent graphic aesthetic. The artist’s work has been linked to global currents of ecodis and global struggle by provoking a sense of dread and analyzing the semantic balance that exists between the two.
