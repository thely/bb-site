#### Packetsphere: An Internet Travelogue

This is a web-based multimedia piece I did with [Zak Argabrite](https://www.zakargabrite.com/) for the [BROWSER Festival](https://browsersound.com). You can [read more about it](/work/packetsphere), or [dive straight into the piece itself.](https://packetsphere-breckelli.vercel.app/) Tell Karen I say hi.

#### the car show: call for artists

I'm holding a call for artists for the first edition of the Incurable Caravan's Online Car Show. If you make something that can be experienced online, and can make something car-adjacent, you could almost certainly submit. [Take a look!](/work/online-car-show)
